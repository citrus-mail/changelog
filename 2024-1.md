# Zest Changelog

### January

We're almost ready to launch Zest in Beta.

Latest updates:

- Fixed bug while onboarding, after payment it would not redirect to the right step.
- We removed Primary/Updates/Promotional categories. We want to improve labels so you can use them as categories. Simplifying the UI.
